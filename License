                   GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                      Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. [https://fsf.org/](https://fsf.org/)
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast,
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use this
General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
any other work released this way by its authors. You can use it for
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they
know their rights.

  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and
developers' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
authors of previous versions.

  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such
abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is
precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed
this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If
such problems arise on other products, we stand ready to extend this
provision to those products in future versions of the GPL, as needed to
protect the freedom of users.

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
make special effort to protect free software's users and developers from
the danger of accruing patents.

  The FSF's General Public Licenses are designed to ensure that your
freedom to share and change free software is guaranteed. They make sure
that you, the user, can do these things and that the code remains free
for all users.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on
the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to
the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature
that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user
that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that
warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under
this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface
presents a list of user commands or options, like a menu, a prominent
item in the list would suffice.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of
a work.

A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form. A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

The "Corresponding Source" for a Non-Source work means all the source
code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the
Non-Source work and to modify the work. This includes, but is not
limited to, all the program files, header files, interface definition
files, scripts used to control compilation and installation, or object
code libraries that the work links against, as well as the source code
for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work
is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts
of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in module form need not include the
source code for any module that is a Major Component, but must include
all program files, header files, interface definition files, scripts
used to control compilation and installation, or object code libraries
that the work links against, as well as the source code for shared
libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts
of the work.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your
right of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,
without condition so long as your license otherwise remains in effect.
You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities
for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this
License in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright.
Those thus making or running the covered works on your behalf must do so
strictly under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them
from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship
with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the
conditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed. Sections 10 and 11
protect the authors and licensors by explaining that there is no warranty
for this Program.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of
the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws
prohibiting or restricting circumvention of technological measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License, and you disclaim any
intention to limit operation or modification of the work.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and
you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a. The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
and giving a relevant date.

b. The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
released under this License and any conditions added under section 7.
This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact
all notices".

c. You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore
apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the
whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are
packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any
other way, but it does not invalidate permission you may have separately
to license original versions of the Program under other licenses.

d. If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
"Appropriate Legal Notices"; however, if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work
need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and
which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or
on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"Aggregate". When this License applies to a covered work in an
Aggregate, the other works in the Aggregate are not covered by this
License.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
Machine-Readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of the ways stated in section 6.

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", meaning any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a
consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.
For a particular product received by a particular user, "normally used"
refers to a typical or common use of that class of product,
regardless of the status of the particular user. Software incorporated in
a user product is a "user product" if it is included in the user product.

The "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or materially negatively affected by the
modification of the Installation Information.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part
of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the User
Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed
term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the
Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if neither
you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object
code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide network services, or services for
running, or providing data storage for, a work that has been modified or
installed by the recipient.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
Machine-Readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of the ways stated in section 6.

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions to one or more of its conditions.
"Removed permissions" are terms that remove permission that this
License gives in a specific case.

You may add to the terms of this License additional permissions, but this
is only allowed if you do so within the limits of this License. If you
add terms to the terms of this License, you must make sure that they are
not in conflict with any of the terms of this License. If you are adding
terms to a work that is already licensed under this License, you must
make sure that the original terms and the terms of this License remain in
effect for all parts of the work. If you are adding terms to a work
that is not yet licensed under this License, you must make sure that the
terms of this License are part of your additional terms, and that the
work remains subject to this License.

If you are adding terms to a work that is not yet licensed under this
License, you must make sure that the terms of this License are part of
your additional terms, and that the work remains subject to this License.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify a covered work is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted by the
individual contributors to the work).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates
your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to
notify you of the violation by any reasonable means prior to 60 days
after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of
violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and
you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a
copy of the Program. Ancillary to a peer-to-peer transmission, a copy of
a covered work may be received without any formal consent. However, only
this License gives you permission to propagate or modify any covered work.
These actions require your explicit acceptance of this License.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives
a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that
work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties with this License.

11. Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work
thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or
controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter
acquired, that would be infringed by some manner permitted by this
License.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not
impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of the
rights granted by this License.

This section is intended to protect the users of this Program from the
danger of software patents. It is also intended to protect the users of
this Program from the danger of patent infringement claims.

12. No Free Lunch.

It is not required that you convey the Program without charge. You may
charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may
offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
