# EmPower1 - Architectural Specification: AI Governance Lifecycle

**Document ID:** EMP-TS-004

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

This document provides the technical specification for the governance framework that manages the lifecycle of all Artificial Intelligence (AI) models within the EmPower1 ecosystem. It directly addresses Refinement #4 from the Architectural Attestation Document (EMP-AAD-001), which identified the need for a robust process to govern AI model evolution.

The purpose of this specification is to define a secure, transparent, and community-driven process for proposing, testing, deploying, and, if necessary, deactivating AI models. This ensures that these powerful components remain aligned with the project's mission and the community's will.

## 2. Core Principles of AI Governance

The framework is built on four core principles:

1.  **Community-Led:** The EmPower1 DAO holds ultimate authority over all AI models and the governance process itself.
2.  **Security First:** The process is designed with multiple gates to prevent the deployment of malicious, biased, or technically flawed models.
3.  **Verifiable Transparency:** All proposals, source code, audits, and test results related to AI models must be publicly accessible.
4.  **Structured Predictability:** The lifecycle follows a clear, multi-phased process, ensuring all stakeholders understand the path from proposal to deployment.

## 3. The AI Model Lifecycle: A Phased Governance Approach

Any new AI model or any significant update to an existing model must pass through the following five phases:

### Phase 1: Proposal
An "AI Model Improvement Proposal" (AMIP) can be submitted by any community member who meets a minimum token staking requirement. The AMIP is a formal document that must include:
*   The complete, open-source code of the proposed model.
*   A detailed technical paper explaining the model's architecture, methodology, and intended improvements.
*   A comprehensive report showing the model's performance against standardized, public benchmark datasets.
*   The proposed initial parameter settings for the model.

### Phase 2: Professional Audit & Community Review
Once an AMIP is submitted, it enters a mandatory **28-day review period**.
*   **Community Review:** The proposal is open for public discussion on community forums.
*   **Professional Auditing:** The EmPower1 Foundation is required to commission a minimum of two independent, professional audits from reputable firms specializing in AI and smart contract security. The full, unredacted audit reports must be made public before the end of the review period.

### Phase 3: Live Sandbox Deployment
If the AMIP passes the review phase without any critical vulnerabilities being discovered, it is deployed to the **EmPower1 Sandbox Network**.
*   **Purpose:** The Sandbox is a permanent, public testnet that mirrors the mainnet environment.
*   **Execution:** The proposed model runs in parallel with the current production model. Its decisions and outputs are recorded publicly but are **not** executed on the Sandbox network.
*   **Duration:** The model must run in the Sandbox for a minimum of **90 days** to allow the community to observe its behavior, performance, and stability under live conditions.

### Phase 4: On-Chain Governance Vote
After the mandatory Sandbox period, if the model has performed as expected, the original proposer can elevate the AMIP to a formal, binding on-chain governance vote. The EmPower1 DAO token holders vote on whether to approve the model for mainnet deployment.

### Phase 5: Mainnet Activation
If the governance vote passes, the new model is scheduled for activation. The AI Oracle Network nodes are given a grace period to update their software, and the new model becomes active at a specific, predetermined block height.

## 4. Emergency Override Mechanism: The AI Security Council

To safeguard the network against unforeseen critical issues with a live AI model, an **AI Security Council (ASC)** will be established.

*   **Composition:** The ASC is a 9-member multisig council elected by the DAO. Members should be reputable security experts, AI specialists, and community stakeholders.
*   **Limited Power:** The ASC's sole power is the ability to trigger a temporary, emergency shutdown of a live AI model. A 7-of-9 vote is required. The ASC **cannot** propose, modify, or deploy models itself.
*   **Fallback State:** An emergency shutdown immediately reverts the affected system to a simpler, non-AI "fallback state." For example, if the `ValidatorReputationModel` is shut down, validator selection would temporarily revert to being based purely on stake weight.
*   **DAO Supremacy:** Any action by the ASC is temporary and can be immediately overridden by a new, emergency DAO vote. The ASC serves as a rapid-response circuit breaker, not a replacement for community governance.

## 5. Conclusion

This multi-phased governance lifecycle provides a robust and resilient framework for managing the powerful AI components of the EmPower1 ecosystem. By combining community-driven proposals, mandatory professional audits, live sandbox testing, and binding on-chain voting, the process ensures that only secure, effective, and community-approved models are deployed. The AI Security Council adds a critical layer of protection, providing a vital safeguard against emergent threats while upholding the ultimate authority of the DAO.
